RunPod Proxy port not working therefore we overwrite file automatically and start with a Gradio live share

Use the Gradio live share link provided after started

If you rent multiple GPU machine, you can start different instances on each GPU by changing export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 2 3 4 etc

If you restart the pod you have to run below command 1 time after each restart before running above starting command

apt update --yes
apt install ffmpeg --yes
